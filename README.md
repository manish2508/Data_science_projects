Business Objective

Business Context:
In the dynamic and competitive telecom industry of India and Southeast Asia, customer retention is a strategic priority. The annual churn rate of 15-25% emphasizes the importance of predicting and preventing customer churn. The dataset, spanning four consecutive months, presents an opportunity to leverage customer behavior patterns to proactively identify high-value customers at risk of churn.

Business Objective:
The primary business objective is to develop predictive models for identifying high-value customers at risk of churn. The predictive task involves utilizing customer-level data from the first three months (6, 7, and 8) to forecast churn in the fourth month (9). By understanding customer behavior during the 'Good' and 'Action' phases, the objective is to enhance the telecom company's ability to take corrective actions and retain high-value customers.

Key Components:
Churn Prediction:

Utilize data from the 'Good' and 'Action' phases to predict customer churn in the 'Churn' phase (Month 9).
Apply machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) for accurate predictions.
High-Value Customer Definition:

Identify high-value customers based on specific metrics contributing to approximately 80% of the total revenue.
Focus on predicting churn for this segment, aiming to reduce revenue leakage.
Customer Lifecycle Understanding:

Leverage the three-phase customer lifecycle model ('Good', 'Action', 'Churn') to capture the dynamic nature of customer behavior.
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing data, outliers, and necessary transformations.
Create relevant features based on customer behavior during the 'Good' and 'Action' phases.
Model Evaluation and Selection:

Assess the performance of predictive models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Select the most effective model for accurate churn predictions.
Recommendation Strategies:

Develop actionable strategies based on model insights to retain high-value customers during the 'Action' phase.
Tailor strategies to address specific issues identified during the predictive analysis.
Implementation and Monitoring:

Implement recommended strategies and monitor their effectiveness over time.
Iterate and adapt strategies based on ongoing customer behavior and feedback.
Success Metrics:
Churn Prediction Accuracy: Achieve a high accuracy rate in predicting customer churn in the 'Churn' phase, specifically for high-value customers.

Retention Rate Improvement: Measure the improvement in retaining high-value customers by implementing targeted strategies based on predictive insights.

Revenue Leakage Reduction: Quantify the reduction in revenue leakage attributed to proactive churn management and retention efforts.

By achieving these objectives, the telecom company aims to strengthen customer relationships, enhance satisfaction, and maximize revenue from its high-value customer segment.
